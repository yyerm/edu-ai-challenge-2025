# Battleship Game Refactoring Overview

## Summary

The Battleship game codebase was modernized and refactored to improve maintainability, readability, and extensibility. The refactoring focused on adopting modern C# features, encapsulating state, and separating concerns into distinct classes.

## Key Refactoring Actions

### 1. **Separation of Concerns**
- **Game logic** is now encapsulated in the `BattleshipGame` class.
- **Board state and operations** are managed by the `Board` class.
- **Ship data and status** are handled by the `Ship` class.
- **CPU opponent logic** is implemented in the `CpuOpponent` class.
- The `Program` class is now a minimal entry point.

### 2. **Encapsulation and State Management**
- Eliminated global/static mutable variables.
- All game state is managed through class instances and private fields.
- Each class is responsible for its own data and behavior.

### 3. **Modern C# Features**
- Utilized C# 12 features and .NET 8 APIs.
- Used `async`/`await` for user input to keep the UI responsive and future-proof.
- Employed collection initializers, concise property syntax, and pattern matching.

### 4. **Improved Readability and Maintainability**
- Adopted consistent naming conventions and code style.
- Broke up large methods into smaller, single-responsibility methods.
- Added clear method and variable names for better self-documentation.

### 5. **Extensibility**
- The new structure makes it easy to add features (e.g., new ship types, different board sizes, alternate AI strategies).
- Each component can be tested and maintained independently.

## Result

The refactored codebase is modular, testable, and easier to understand. The core game mechanics and user experience remain unchanged, but the internal structure is now robust and ready for future enhancements.
