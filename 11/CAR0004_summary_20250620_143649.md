A 25-year-old healthy male student and part-time postman presented with sharp, intermittent chest pain over the heart lasting a few seconds, starting three days ago. The pain worsens with coughing or lying down and improves when leaning forward. He rates the pain 6/10 and sometimes feels it radiate to his neck. He has no other symptoms like shortness of breath, palpitations, dizziness, or weakness. Recently recovered from the flu. No significant past medical history, no medications except occasional Tylenol, no smoking or drug use, occasional alcohol. Family history notable for his fatherâ€™s recent fatal heart attack two weeks ago, causing patient significant anxiety about his own symptoms. Physical exam and further workup planned, including ECG and possible blood tests, to rule out cardiac causes. Patient was reassured to avoid excessive worry while awaiting test results.
