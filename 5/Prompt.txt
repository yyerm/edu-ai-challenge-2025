Analyze the following product feedback comments using AI Technique: Information Extraction; Classification; Few-Shot Prompting; Chain-of-Thought Reasoning; Structured Output Generation. For each comment, classify the overall sentiment as "Positive," "Neutral," or "Negative." Then, extract key insights including main issues, suggestions, and any emotional tone or emphasis. Present the results in a structured JSON format as shown in the examples.
In the attachment "task_5_input.docx" there 3 examples how feedback classification should be created.

Analyzing the two feedback examples using the following techniques and structure:
Few-Shot Prompting: Incorporate the 3 provided examples to demonstrate the expected format and reasoning.
Chain-of-Thought Reasoning: incorporate feedback only if it is relevant to the product. If not, set isRelevant to false and skip further analysis.
JSON Output Format: Ensure the AIâ€™s response adheres to the following structure:

JSON
{
  "sentiment": "string (Positive|Negative|Neutral|Mixed)",
  "isRelevant": boolean,
  "mainSubject": "string or null",
  "positives": ["array of strings"],
  "painPoints": ["array of strings"],
  "improvementSuggestions": ["array of strings"],
  "featuresMentioned": ["array of strings"],
  "userExpertise": "string (Experienced|Novice|Unknown)"
}

Feedbacks to analyze:
Feedback 1: "Sensor just stops tracking for like a half second kinda often even at 8000hz. I've also tried it plugged in and still the same problem. First one I got I had to return also because the dongle just didnt work, $150 mouse btw"
Feedback 2: "Is it worth it? It is a product with no flaws in my opinion, if you love it go for it, but its not worth the price since you'll be able to perform the same with a cheaper product with half the specs."
