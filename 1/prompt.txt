You are tasked with selecting the most suitable type of database for a new social platform application. The project requirements are:
    The platform will have millions of users.
    It needs to store user profiles, posts, and connections between users.
    High data read speed is critical.
    Expected workload is approximately 80% read operations and 20% write operations.
    Scalability is important to accommodate user base growth.

Please apply Chain-of-Thought reasoning by following these steps:
    Identify and explain the key requirements of the project that influence database choice.
    Discuss different types of databases (e.g., relational, document, graph, key-value, columnar) and how their characteristics align with the requirements.
    Evaluate trade-offs such as read/write performance, data modeling suitability, and scalability.
    Select the most appropriate database type based on this analysis.
    Justify your selection with clear, logical reasoning that references the project needs.
	
Provide your reasoning in a detailed, step-by-step manner to demonstrate how you arrived at the final decision.
