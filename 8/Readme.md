# Task8 Validation Library

This project provides a robust, extensible validation library for C#/.NET, supporting type-safe validation of strings, numbers, booleans, arrays, and complex objects. The library is designed for easy use in both application code and automated tests.

## How to Use

- **Try the Validator in Application Code:**  
  You can experiment with the validator by editing or adding code to `Program.cs`.  
  Example usage and schema definitions are already present in that file.

- **Run and Explore Tests:**  
  The `Task8.Tests` project contains comprehensive NUnit tests for all validator features.  
  You can run these tests to see the validator in action and to verify its correctness.
